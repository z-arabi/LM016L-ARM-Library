  LM016L-ARM-Library
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
 </h2>
As we know, we have two kinds of LCD, one graphical and the other is character. In this project, a library is written for one of the popular character LCD, LM016L. 

<h2>
  Implementation
</h2>
The library is based on ARM Programming Language and written in Keil uVision, which is a window-based software development platform for ARM-based microcontrollers. 
The microcontroller used is STM32F103 - Arm Cortex-M3 Microcontrollers.
There are multiple libraries for writing the program to implement on ARM microcontrollers, and generally, I would prefer to use HAL library for STM32 ARM Cortex.
